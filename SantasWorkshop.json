  "description" : [
    "Santa gets millions of letters asking for presents each year. He needs help sorting through it all to make sure he fulfils each child’s wishes!",
    "Many children have terrible handwriting, so the solution will need to be able to decipher the mail, as well as process emails, and voice phone calls, to generate toy orders for his elves to produce. These toy orders need to be consolidated into reports, as the elves need to know how many of each kind of toy needs to be produced.",
    "The toy orders then have to be put together and stocked into Santa’s magic storeroom sack, with its specific location recorded along with child’s details.",
    "While riding his sleigh, Santa needs locations of each home, what presents to deliver to which child, where in his sack he can find the presents, and any hazards he needs to be aware of when delivering these presents. Santa’s sleigh is as fast as lightning. He values speed and accuracy because the smallest mistakes can bring a child disappointment."
